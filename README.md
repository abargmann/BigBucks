## Set Up 

### Prerequsities: 

(the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) docs do a good job outlining this as well)

#### Xcode 

Get from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

#### Node 

Use the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager to install node.

`brew install node`

#### Watchman 

Install watchman 

`brew install watchman`

This lets you not have to reload the app manually to reflect changes.  

#### React Native CLI Tools 

Useful for working with React Native apps but not necessary 

`npm install -g react-native-cli`

### Running the App 

You can now clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:abargmann/BigBucks.git`

And then run it in the iOS simulator.  This will do a few things: open xcode, open another terminal window, open the simulator:

From the project directory:

`react-native run-ios`   

### Handy tips: 

In the simulator, hit `Command+D` and enable live reload.  In addition, open debugger tools - this will give you a browser window with a debug console.  Handy for working with react native.
